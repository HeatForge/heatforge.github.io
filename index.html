                <h3>Artist</h3>
                <p>I have started art as a hobby that I very much enjoy. As of right now I am pursuing art as a great passion of mine, hoping that one day it will become my job.
                    I don't have much skill but it is something I am hoping to aleviate in the future.

                <h3>Game Design</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently working on my first game Alchimist that I believe is nearing it's completion after that I plan on developing far more games.
                    I hope that I can still make these games until I run out of ideas.

                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    Right now only field of programming I geniuenly specialize in is game programming. However I know how to code in Python, Lua and JavaScript.
                    I am also skilled in web development and building interactive websites. I have multiple plans for my future in classic programming.
